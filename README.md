# BERT for Relation Classification

This repository contains Tensorflow 2 implementations of BERT-based models
for relation classification, as given in Figure 3 of
[Matching the Blanks: Distributional Similarity for Relation Learning](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1279/)

See `run.py` for example usage.
